Hello! 
My name is Sonia RM Karungi, a highly inquisitive and self-driven person with interests ranging from learning Web technologies and how they can be applied to help in the day-to-day lives of others, travelling, reading, watching reality shows such as the Amazing Race and Survivor, listening to music and playing puzzle games!
